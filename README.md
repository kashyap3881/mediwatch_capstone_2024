## Orchestration

### Build the docker image 

1. Clone the git repo 
```
Kashyaps-MBP: kashyapkambhatla$ git clone git@github.com:kashyap3881/mediwatch_capstone_2024.git
Cloning into 'mediwatch_capstone_2024'...

Receiving objects: 100% (33/33), 7.33 MiB | 11.26 MiB/s, done.
Resolving deltas: 100% (7/7), done.
```

2. Run the below command to generate the docker image. As shown below different versions could be built
```
Kashyaps-MBP:mediwatch_capstone_2024 kashyapkambhatla$ docker build --build-arg PORT=9003 -t mediwatch:v1 .

### Create namespace, deployment and service 

1. Create a namespace for the application 
```
(base) Kashyaps-MBP:mediwatch_capstone_2024 kashyapkambhatla$ kubectl create ns mediwatch 
namespace/mediwatch created

(base) Kashyaps-MBP:mediwatch_capstone_2024 kashyapkambhatla$ kubectl get ns
NAME              STATUS   AGE
default           Active   75d
kube-node-lease   Active   75d
kube-public       Active   75d
kube-system       Active   75d
mediwatch         Active   4s
test-model        Active   36d
```

2. Create deployment template and deploy in the namespace 
```
(base) Kashyaps-MBP:~ kashyapkambhatla$ cat mediwatchdep.yaml 
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mediwatch-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mediwatch
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mediwatch
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mediwatch-container
        image: mediwatch:v1
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent 
        ports:
        - containerPort: 9003
        env:
        - name: PORT
          value: "9003"  # Note: Environment variable values are strings
```

```
(base) Kashyaps-MBP:~ kashyapkambhatla$ kubectl apply -f mediwatchdep.yaml -n mediwatch 
deployment.apps/mediwatch-deployment created

(base) Kashyaps-MBP:~ kashyapkambhatla$ kubectl get pods -n mediwatch 
NAME                                   READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
mediwatch-deployment-9b76d8b57-5wtsv   1/1     Running   0          8s
```

2. Create service template and deploy in the namespace. This will help expose the service to become accessible via a nodeport and also serve as a load balancer 

```
(base) Kashyaps-MBP:~ kashyapkambhatla$ cat mediwatchservice.yaml 
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mediwatch-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: mediwatch
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 9003
      nodePort: 30085
  type: NodePort
```

```
(base) Kashyaps-MBP:~ kashyapkambhatla$ kubectl apply -f mediwatchservice.yaml -n mediwatch 
service/mediwatch-service created

(base) Kashyaps-MBP:~ kashyapkambhatla$ kubectl get service -n mediwatch 
NAME                TYPE       CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)        AGE
mediwatch-service   NodePort   10.109.141.194   <none>        80:30085/TCP   14s

```

3. Access the application via browser at http://ip:30085/. If deploying on your MAC/PC then you could use http://localhost:30085/


## Application
1. Accessing the applcation would bring up a window as shown below.


![figures/app_start.png](figures/app_start.png)

2. Click on the Choose File button to upload the CSV file. A sample test file is provided in the repo as test_data.csv

3. Click on the Predict button to get the prediction results.

4. The readmission prediction results for every patient would then be displayed as shown below.
